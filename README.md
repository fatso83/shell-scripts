My one-off scriptlets
=====================

**Old and forgotten**
The scripts I actually use on a daily basis are in [my dotfiles repo](https://github.com/fatso83/dotfiles/tree/master/utils/scripts). I just keep this old repo around for historical purposes and to stuff one-off scripts into, in case I should need the code sometime.

These are scriptlets that contain code I have found useful and worth reusing in little utility applications I seem to write over and over again. In the hopes that this might prove useful for other people out there, this repo is public. Let's just hope I do not hardcode my social security number or something... ;)

.sh files are scripts that can be run. These might depend on other library files.
.inc files are library functions that can be reused.
